# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Project

This repository contains code and resources related to my Support Vector Machine (SVM) project. In this project, I explore SVM algorithms, cover different types of kernel functions, and showcase various practical applications. The content is designed to help anyone understand and implement SVM models effectively.

## Project Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. This repository includes:
- Code for implementing SVMs with different kernels
- Visualizations of decision boundaries

For a more detailed overview, please check out my [presentation on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mahdi-poorjahangiri_svm-presentation-activity-7261356000488656897-5V6k?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).
